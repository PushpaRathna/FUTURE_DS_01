Overview

This project focuses on analyzing trending topics on social media platforms (like Twitter) to understand user interests and market shifts.
By analyzing the sentiment and volume of tweets, the goal is to identify patterns and provide actionable insights for businesses. 
The project also includes visualizations of sentiment distributions and trends over time.

Skills Learned
•	Web Scraping: Learned how to extract real-time social media data using Python libraries like Tweepy and BeautifulSoup.
•	Sentiment Analysis: Gained experience in performing sentiment analysis using TextBlob to assess public sentiment on trending topics.
•	Data Visualization: Enhanced skills in visualizing trends and sentiment distributions using tools like Power BI, Excel, and Matplotlib.
•	Natural Language Processing (NLP): Applied NLP techniques to preprocess tweet data, tokenize, and analyze text for sentiment.


Tools Used
•	Python: The primary programming language used for data extraction, analysis, and visualization.
•	Tweepy: A Python library for interacting with the Twitter API to fetch real-time tweet data and trending topics.
•	TextBlob: Used for performing sentiment analysis on tweets and classifying them into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
•	Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization libraries used to create insightful charts and graphs of tweet trends and sentiment distributions.
•	Power BI/Excel: Tools used to create interactive dashboards and reports for visualizing the social media insights.

Deliverables
•	Sentiment Analysis Model: A machine learning model that classifies tweet sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
•	Trending Topic Dashboard: A dynamic dashboard showcasing the most discussed topics, sentiment insights, and tweet volumes.
•	Sentiment Distribution Visualization: Graphical representations (e.g., bar charts, word clouds) showing sentiment distribution across topics and over time.
•	Report: A report summarizing sentiment analysis results, key insights from trending topics, and the distribution of sentiments.

Methodologies:
•	Data Extraction (e.g., from Twitter using Tweepy API)
•	Data Preprocessing (cleaning and tokenizing text)
•	Data Visualization (using word clouds and sentiment distribution)
•	Sentiment Analysis (using TextBlob)
•	 Machine Learning Model (using a classifier like Linear Regression for sentiment classification)

Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
•	Extract Data: Use the Tweepy API to fetch trending topics and associated tweets from Twitter.
•	Data Cleaning: Clean tweet data by removing URLs, special characters, and stopwords, and normalize the text for analysis.
2. Sentiment Analysis
•	Sentiment Classification: Apply TextBlob to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on the text's polarity.
•	Sentiment Labeling: Assign sentiment labels to each tweet and prepare data for further analysis.
3. Model Building
•	Model Selection: Use a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines) to predict tweet sentiment based on audio features or text features.
•	Model Training and Evaluation: Train the model on historical data and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
4. Sentiment Distribution Visualization
•	Data Visualization: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations of sentiment distribution, including bar charts and time-based analyses.
•	Trend Visualizations: Create graphs to show tweet volume and sentiment distribution over time, highlighting key moments of shifts in public sentiment.
5. Report Writing
•	Model Performance: Summarize the results of the sentiment analysis and model evaluation.
•	Key Insights: Discuss the most significant trends and insights, including the key factors affecting public sentiment in tweets.
